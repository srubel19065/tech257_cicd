# Continuous Integration (CI)

## What is it
CI is a software development practice which focuses on frequently making changes to code. It does this through merging code changes frequently to a main branch which gives feedback on that code through a fully automated build/test process.

## Why?
1. Early Bug detection
   - Constantly merging small code and testing each time will prevent larger issues in the future and helps to keep code working throughout the dev lifecycle
2. Faster Delivery cycles
   - CI is automated so its quicker plus removes manual steps so changes can be pushed quicker
3. Prevents human error

## Where 


## When
1. You want efficient and clean code
   - If the developers have a huge project, they want to be consistently working and having smooth code as an issue where they dont know the problem will lead to wasting time
2. Deadline
3. When a team is working on a project with multiple developers
